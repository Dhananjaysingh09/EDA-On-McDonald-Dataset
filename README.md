This repository contains an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the McDonald's dataset. The dataset provides valuable insights into various aspects of McDonald's menu, including items, nutrition facts, ingredients, categories, and more. By performing EDA on this dataset, we aim to uncover interesting patterns, trends, and correlations to gain a deeper understanding of McDonald's offerings.

It includes information such as item names, category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.), ingredients, nutrition facts (calories, fat content, protein, etc.), and more. The dataset is rich in detail and provides a comprehensive snapshot of the McDonald's menu.
EDA Goals:
The primary goals of this EDA project are as follows:

Explore the distribution of menu items across different categories.
